# AKAN NAME GENERATOR
#### This is an application that outputs to the user their Akan name depending on their gender and date of birth., 2021
#### By **Sharon Apot.**
## Description
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. 
This app takes a user's birthday on the form provided and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements
This application can be accessed via the link: shazz-designing.github.io/akan-names/

To use it, all that a user need to input are;

i) Day of Birth

ii) Month of Birth

iii) Year of Birth

Iv) Gender

With the above information from the user, the app is able to generate the Akan Name.

## Known Bugs
Formula provided to determine day of birth shows inconsistency. I fixed this by adding a formula to convert the data collected by the user to date and then convert the same to 
an index for the day of birth so as to use the arrays to determine the day of birth.

## Technologies Used
